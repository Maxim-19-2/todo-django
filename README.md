# Create a todo-list with django
This is a simple todo-list application created with the Django framework.

# Getting Started
1. Install Python
2. Install [Django] (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/install/)
3. Clone this git repository and navigate to the "todolist" folder. There should be a manage.py file located here.
4. Open up a terminal and type:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
5. Now the server is running and you can connect to it at Port 8000 on localhost. Paste http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser's URL bar to start using the app!
